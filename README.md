### Planner Generator

This is a software I created to help me generate my
own planner layouts.

This allows us to completely customize the features,
size, and positioning of elements in our planners
through small tweaks.

Use `npm start` or `node jade-dev` to start the jade server,
and then navigate to [`localhost:8080/weekly-planner.jade`](http://localhost:8080/weekly-planner.jade)
to view and print the calendar. Some tweaks may need to be made
to the [`weekly-planner.jade`](./weekly-planner.jade) file if
the layout is too big or small.

Happy hacking!
